      BC and passed each AP exam. During my Junior year, I took the SAT, achieving 1370(740 on math). The summer that
      I graduated from Woodhaven, I started attending Kettering University for a degree in Computer Science. Not long after
      I landed my first Co-op at Ford Motor Company which is where I am currently employed. I am now a Junior and am

  <div class="p-mx-auto p-col-12" style="padding: 0">
    <p class="regular-text">I am currently employed at Ford Motor Company as a Co-op student and have been since Fall
      2019. During my first semester there, I worked in Connected Vehicles as a Software Engineer. I was not given many tasks
      at the beginning so I had to keep myself busy. I ended up discovering a need for a search engine for data coming
      off of cars, which I later developed, pitched, and brought to production in my first 3  months there(more info <a class="in-text-link" href="../projects/fordsearchengine">HERE</a>).
      In my next two terms, I was in a new department and had the job of a full stack web developer making an internal site for
      remotely monitoring vehicles using Java, AngularJS.
