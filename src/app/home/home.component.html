    <span>Education</span>
  </div>
  <div class="p-mx-auto p-col-12">
    <span class="regular-text">I graduated from Woodhaven High School in the summer of 2019. During my time there I was
      involved in many activities. Starting my Freshman year, I played varsity tennis and Varsity hockey and hold a school
      record for the number of wins in a doubles season for tennis. I also took AP Computer Science, Statistics, and Calculus
      BC and passed each AP exam. During my Junior year, I took the SAT, achieving a 1370(740 on math). The summer that
      I graduated from Woodhaven, I started attending Kettering University for a degree in Computer Science. Not long after
      I landed my first Co-op at Ford Motor Company which is where I am currently employed. I am now a Junior there am
      projected to graduate in March of 2023.</span>

    <span>Employment</span>
  </div>
  <div class="p-mx-auto p-col-12">
    <span class="regular-text">I am currently employed at Ford Motor Company as a Co-op student and have been since Fall
      2019. My first semester there, I worked in Connected Vehicles as a Software Engineer. I was not given many tasks
      at the beginning so I had to keep myself busy. I ended up discovering a need for a search engine for data coming
      off of cars, which I later developed, pitched, and brought to production in my first 3  months there(more info HERE).
      My next two terms I was in a new department and had the job of a full stack web developer making an internal site for
      remotely monitoring vehicles using Java, AngularJS.
