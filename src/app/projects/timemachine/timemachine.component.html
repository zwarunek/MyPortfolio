        Time Machine is a project that I have recently started. This is a Minecraft plugin that is used mainly by server
        administrators to backup and restore worlds and players on their server. To my knowledge, this is the only plugin
        that gives server admins the ability to pick individual Minecraft chunks that they want to either backup or
        restore. This is accomplished by using Minecraftâ€™s NBT file which they use to store player and world data.

        I think that the best takeaway from this project is learning code maintainability and working on something that
        will need to evolve as the game of minecraft evolves. Other key takeaways are taking feedback from actual users
        of it and making sure that every update that I make doesnt ruin someones server on accident.
